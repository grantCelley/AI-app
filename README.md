Well this is an example of a computer vision application.

We need to ask the several questions:

1. What problem are we trying to solve?
2. What data do we need?
3. What platform do we want to distribute to?

# What problem are we solving?

My mother had brain surgary that made her blind in one eye. Not only did it made her blind but it can make it hard for her to process visual information and gets overwelmed. My mother loves to sew but will loose peices of the sewing machine. So I want a way for her to find peices of the sewing machine if she losses it.

This is a basic object detection problem

# What data do we need?

So we will take pictures of the diffent parts of the machine. Then we will use [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) to lable bounding boxes.
We will train the data off of this data.

# What platform do we want to distribute to?

Android. It will be easy for my mom to have her phone do the heave lifting. If I were to use a server-host it would take too long for lag.
